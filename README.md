### World of Ghibli was ...
a one week sprint focusing on fetching from an API in ReactJS using Router4 and storing information in the Redux store. Components, containers, and fetch calls were tested using unit and asyncronous testing.
### In the World of Ghibli,
you can scroll through several Studio Ghibli films, each with a movie cover image, and a description of the film. If you enter your name, you can click the play game button which takes you to the game route. In the game, there are character names with clues for each character. If you unscramble a name, an awesome image from a Studio Ghibli film pops up with a "Great Job!" message. If you do not correctly unscramble the name, the button turns red. But you can try again! Have fun!
